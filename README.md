## Project Name
Predict which tweets are about real dissters and which ones are not in a couple lines of code.
Data for calculation taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started



### General info
If you need to get quickly some initial results in typical NLP task 
than using packes [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair), [Texthero](https://texthero.org/) and [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html) would give quite good results.
